# BuildFlow Roadmap

BuildFlow is initially focused on support streaming and event driven use cases. With this initial support we plan on supporting many of the popular queue and streaming resources, including:

- GCP Pub/Sub
- AWS SQS
- Kafka
- Redis Streams

We also plan on support many of the common databases and data warehouses, including:

- Google Cloud BigQuery
- AWS Redshift
- Snowflake
- Postgres

If there are any other queue or resources you would like to see supported, feel free to file a feature request on [Github](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow/issues)

## Streaming / Event Driven Improvements

As parot of supporting streaming and event driven use cases, we are working on the following improvements:

- Windowing
- Checkpointing
- Improved stateful processing

## Future Improvements

As BuildFlow evolves we want to support many more use cases, including:

- Batch processing
- HTTP Endpoints
