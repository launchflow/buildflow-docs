    With BuildFlow we have been focused on developer experience and correctness. We want someone to be able to be able to get started with BuildFlow in a matter of minutes without having to worry about the correctness of the underlying runtime. At the same time we chose to build our runtime on top of <a href="https://www.ray.io">Ray</a> which has shown to be one of the most powerfull distributed computing frameworks available. So as we continue to improve BuildFlow you can expect to see it become more and more effecient.
